# Flight delays prediction [EN]
The purpose of this project is to predict arrival delays of the flights based on some characteristics.

The analysis is conducted in Python, using mainly pandas, seaborn and LightGBM.

The project was created in 2020 when my knowledge of writing clean code was limited, so the code could be a little untidy. Possibly, it could be properly adjusted in the future.
